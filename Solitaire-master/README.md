A Solitaire card game I made in 7 days with Unity 2021 LTS using Model-View-Presenter architecture, dependency injection, reactive and asynchronous programming. The game uses advanced Zenject features like factories and memory pools. The user interface was made using Unity UI and TextMeshPro and the animations were done with tweening. The game logic is covered with Unit tests.

**Features:**
* Classic gameplay
* Draw rules (1 and 3 cards)
* Scoring
* Leaderboard
* Undo system
* Hint system
* Audio system
* Adaptive layout (portrait and landscape)
* Banner ad integration

**Unity packages:**

**3rd party plugins:**
* Zenject / Extenject
* UniRx
* UniTask
